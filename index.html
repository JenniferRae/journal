			<h1>The Journal Begins</h1>
			<p>My first month of web development and I&#8217m starting to understand the flow of design. To sit and watch videos and answer questions only got me so far. I have a study routine that focuses on new reading, videos, and hands on coding. One of my favorite quotes by Walt Disney, &ldquo;Keep Moving Forward&rdquo;</p>

					<h2>End of May</h2>
					<h3>Deer in Headlights</h3>
				</header>
				<body>
					<p>This is the end of the first month. About to start my second month. Looking back on May, I felt like a &ldquo;deer in headlights&rdquo;. A lot to read, a lot to watch, a lot to try to understand. This weekend (before the next series of classes is to start) I decided to get a jumpstart on what&#8217s to come. Working a lot on JavaScript and reviewing some HTML and CSS. The lightbulb didn&#8217t &ldquo;fully&rdquo; come on, it&#8217s more of a nice beginning glow.</p>
